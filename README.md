# Suckless Hot Keys
Although not suckless in theory, the configuration of this applicaiton is meant to replicate suckless programs. This program just looks at the keyboard input event and runs actions based on the type of key and what the user specifies.

## todo
create struct to take in key and command
and create function to read struct and run through if statment in while loop
create config.def.h and custom rc file in config folder later
